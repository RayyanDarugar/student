    "# Homework Questions\n",
    "Please answer all of these questions on your personal blog and **explain**. Don't just give an answer. Homework is due Sunday night at 6 pm\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IP Addresses\n",
    "1. Which of the following IP Addresses are possible? Explain (yes/no) for each answer choice.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " - 1.1.1.1.1 NO (more than 4 digits )\n",
    " - 23.23.23.23 YES (fits 4 digits)\n",
    " - 134.492.100.0 NO (492 over limit)\n",
    " - 255.256.55.255 NO (256 over limit)\n",
    " - 2.93.255.19 YES (fits all reqs - 4 digit limit and number cap)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If Dian Du is at home on his home network and sends a message to every computer on the network, what is this an example of? Explain.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- Multicast\n",
    "- Unicast\n",
    "- Broadcast THIS ONE because broadcast is all computers on a network\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Models\n",
    "1. Three of the four following protocols are on the same layer. Identify which ones and what layer they are on, and why they are on each layer:\n",
    "    - ASCII (see above for information):\n",
    "        - Application layer (handles exchanging information for its displayed characters)\n",
    "    - FTP (facilitates transfer of files over the internet) \n",
    "        - Application Layer - communicates files used by applications to provide user services and exchange data \n",
    "    - TLS (see HTTPS section) \n",
    "        - Application Layer as its part of HTTPS along with SSL and handles application encryptoon\n",
    "    - USB (permits data exchange between electronics)\n",
    "        - Physical Layer transfers files through physical means\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Telnet is a internet protocol which allows remote access to other computers over a local network or the internet. What layer of the OSI model would this protocol be located on? What is the function of this layer?\n",
    "    - Data Link layer by definition of transfering files on a local network but Application Layer in it that it connects to command lines and gives users the interface to access the network so APPLICATION LAYER \n",
    "\n",
    "#### DNS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bob wants to use the domain bob.is.the.best.com. What domain should he buy from a DNS provider (assume it is available)? What would be the subdomains?\n",
    "    - best.com is the domain he needs to buy\n",
    "    - sub domains are the, is, and bob\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTTP and HTTPS\n",
    "1. What is a difference between HTTP and HTTPS? \n",
    "<br>\n",
    " - What protocol does HTTPS use that HTTP doesn't?\n",
    "    - HTTPS is different because of the S - stands for Secure. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS protocols to encrypt the data and protect it from third parties\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Last trimester we sent HTTP requests for our passion projects\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " - Did we use HTTP or HTTPS?\n",
    "    - We used HTTP\n",
    " - What are the benefits and disadvantages of this?\n",
    "    - More simple, faster speed. Insecure, open to malicious attack or privacy concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TCP and UDP\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bob is setting up a video streaming service, and he needs the stream to be real time. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    " - What protocol should he use, TCP or UDP? Why?\n",
    "    - UDP as its super quick and doesn't worry as much about complete perfection for every frame/data \n",
    " - What are some cons of this protocol? Give an example of a potential issue.\n",
    "    - Little data checking = unreliable and some packets can get lost, making video quality drop\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. TCP has error checking, which ensures that all packets arrive properly. Why is this important?\n",
    "    - Gives you accuracy and reliability which is essential for tasks where small processes make big differences\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " - Give an example of how TCP ensures that there are no errors.\n",
    "    - mathematical verification like Checksums or sequence numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Server A computer is communicating with Server B. They have already initiated communication and Server A is now attempting to send data to Server B.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    " - How does Server B ensure that they have received any sent packets before Server A continues sending packets in TCP? In UDP?\n",
    "    - Server B sends ACK packets (acknowledging that they got the packets) in TCP. UDP doesn't do this verification in the first place, they assume some data will be lost\n",
    " - What is another use of this?\n",
    "    - maintains control by informing the other computer of the last few bits recieved and sendinng back the ACK bit package"
