Supply and demand interact in the marketplace resulting in a state of equilibrium, surplus, or  shortage. The law of supply states that price and quantity supplied move in the same direction (a direct relationship). Thus, as price  increases, the amount of goods and services supplied increases.

When the amount of a product/service being supplied equals the amount  being demanded, equilibrium exists in the marketplace at that price. If, however, there is more supply than demand for a product a surplus  exists, potentially leading to lower prices. A shortage exists when demand exceeds supply, a condition that can lead to rising prices."

If the issuance of  new shares is more than 25% of the last issue shares then it is treated as the stock split. Property Dividend: Any company can issue any non-monetary dividend to its shareholders. The issued property dividend would be recorded  against the current market price of the asset distributed. As the market price of the asset is expected to be either above or below the book  value therefore it would either incur profit or loss and accordingly would be entered in the books. This interpretation of the distributed asset may force businesses to intentionally issue the property dividend to manipulate the taxable income"
