### PBL Unit 1 / Week 3
Learning outcome: Mastery of previously learned topics, ability to use coding skills in real self-made projects
- LABOR DAY - No school. Sent Mr. Mortensen a message asking for help on web theme adjustments.
- Tuesday - Me and Nathan reviewed all our past work and began researching for the Pair Showcase.
- Wednesday - Created a new program of my own to split up PDF's into headers, bold text, and plain text so I could save time on an assignment for DECA. Integrated Regular Expressions, ChatGPT knowledge, and HTML editing.

- Friday - Fix Github Issues Page, practice for Pair Showcase
